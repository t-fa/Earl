# Earl
C++ game. A main character traverses through a linked list. A generic Space class contains pure virtual functions which inherited classes override. The Spaces are arranged in a doubly linked list with four possible pointers to simulate four directions that Earl can travel. Each Space passes an Earl object by reference within a Game class to allow Earl to traverse the linked list.
